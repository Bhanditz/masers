Switching from 1 to 2" doubles the number of randoms while increasing the total by a factor of 0.4. The percentage of total matches which are randoms increases by a factor of 1.2 ((2/158)/(1/95))

Col 1.5: Number of randoms in this margin assuming 0.5 for 0-1
Col 2: percentage of those which are random
Col 3: Percentage of new matches which are random is this factor times the previous marginal percentage.
Col 4: Percentage of new ones which are random, assuming 0.1% for 0-1"
