70 month Switft-BAT All-Sky hard x-ray survey
Paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3336
Results: http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/bs70mon/
ABSTRACT
+70 month survey deteced 1171 hard x-ray sources associated with 1210 counterparts
   >2x as many as previous 22 month: Most new sources are AGN (over 700 total)
+14-195 keV band to significance of 4.8σ
+most sensitive and uniform hard X-ray all-sky survey
   Flux level 50% sky: 1.03E-11
   Flux level 90% sky: 1.34E-11
1. INTRODUCTION
+This group has previously released data for 3, 9, and 22 months. This extends same to 70.
+Better sensitivity, complete reprocessing of data
   8 channel spectra
   19.5' resolution
   Not biased towards galactic plane
+Special attention given to identification of sources
   3-10 keV x-ray data - based ID on ROSAT data
2. THE SWIFT MISSION AND THE BAT INSTRUMENT
+BAT: Burst Alert Telescope optimized to detect GRB: wide field of view
+XRT narrow field of view pointed in same direction as BAT and moved to point at GRB
+This process moves the telescopes to point seemingly randomly across the sky, appropriating an excellently uniform sky coverage, as compared to INTEGRAL

3.1 Data Processing Improvements
+Data reduction and analysis based on Batt 22 Tueller et al. (2010) EXCEPT:
   Gain correction for each CZT detector
   Thorough cleaning of bright sources from images
   Finer pixelization in mosaicked all-sky maps
+Complete reprocessing of all data leads to more uniform survey
3.2 Gain Correction
+59.5 keV peak has been moving, changing flux for each channel, calibrate: fit peak to 59.5
   Cause of this problem is unknown
3.3 Cleaning of Bright Sources
+Measure flux above 6sigma and subtract contribution of source noise
+100 objects have been designated as always cleaned in every image.
3.4 Pixelization in Mosaicked Sky Maps
+Individual snapshots are combined into mosaicked map
   Pixel pitch changed from 5' to 2.8'
3.5 Crab Weighting
+Total band map 14-195 keV used to simply sum together maps from each band equally weighted
+Devised a new weight for each band based on crab count rates in each
