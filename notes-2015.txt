+ pull-mcp.sh - gets mcp lists (masers and all surveyed (using scdupes.awk)) into csv format from website > mcp.csv and all-mcp.csv > sdss as AllSurveyed2015 and OnlyMasers2015

+ Crossmatch OnlyMasers2015 against Masers2013 to get maser numbers as oldnum > Masers2015

+ Crossmatch AllSurveyed2015 against Masers2015 to filter out masers, in progress... this query is arbitrary but comes up with 3884 which is exactly minus 162

+ Improve pull-mcp.sh AllSurveyed function
	test with $ sudo cp pull-mcp.sh /usr/local/bin/pull-mcp && pull-mcp test.csv -n -c 0

+ Query radius: test at 6' and 10" -- this was previous method, compare discrepancies and decide on each individually.

== DO ==
+ Improve filtering of duplicates and masers from all-surveyed
+ NED query by name, coordinates, vsys? 
+ Run through crossmatches against each catalog
+ Compare name filter with separation filter
+ better separation than declination only
