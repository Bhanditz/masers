SOURCE MATCHING IN THE SDSS AND RASS: WHICH GALAXIES ARE REALLY X-RAY SOURCES

ABSTRACT
Massive galaxies all have central massive black hole but not all are accreting
   X-ray emission identifies accreting sources
RASS vs SDSS DR4: Use SDSS quasars because of high rate of true RASS cross-match

1. INTRODUCTION
+Nearby galaxies often have ambiguous spectra
   Seyfert like: "bona-fide accretion"
   H II-like: active star formation
+X-rays can be helpful to see through obscuring dust to better describe accretion in low-lum AGN
+Broad line Quasars expected to be strong X-ray sources, expect many matches for these
   These matches are expected to be true matches
+RASS has pointed catalogs, large number of sources in small fields scattered across sky
+RASS error circle often contains numerous SDSS sources
   Some star forming galaxies with H-II regions are expected to also have X-ray flux
+XMM and Chandra provide improved resolution but smaller field of view

2. DATA
2.1 SDSS
+DR4 covers 16% of the sky.
   <1.4" photometric & <0.1" astrometric precision
   over 500k galaxies and over 100k quasars
2.1.1 SDSS Galaxies
+Use only main galaxy sample with petrosian r magnitudes > 17.77
   Restricted to this catalog's intersection with MPA/JHU catalog of SDSS objects identified as galaxies
2.1.2 Spectral Classification of Main Sample Galaxies
+Galaxies w/ >2σ flux detection  in Hα, Hβ, [O iii], [N ii], [S ii], [O i] classiﬁed as emission-line
   Hα: 656.3nm Specific red visible spectral line for H from n=3 to n=2
      Brightest wavelength in stellar astronomy
   Hβ: 486.1 Cyan H spectral line (stellar)
   "forbidden" energy transitions not normally allowed by the selection rules of quantum mechanics:
   [O iii]: Doubly ionized O; forbidden line of O^2+ emits green 495.9 and 500.7 nm
      Found in diffuse and planetary nebulae
   [N ii]: forbidden lines of N 654.8 and 658.4 nm
   [S ii]: forbidden lines of S 671.6 and 673.1 nm
   [O i]: 
   Those with some but not all are considered unclassifiable
+Strong line emitters separated into two groups
   Accretion dominated galaxies
   Star formation dominated galaxes w/ hot young stars
+H II, Seyfert, LINERS, and transition objects classified based on line-flux ratios
   [O iii]λ5007/Hβ
   [Nii]λ6583/Hα
   [S ii]λλ6716,6731/Hα
   [O i]λ6300/Hα
2.2 ROSAT All Sky Survey
+Distinct source catalogs from both PSPC and HRI
   WGACAT: 15% of sky
   2RXP: 17% of sky
   HRI catalog (1XRH): 2% of sky with greater precision
+PSPC  Scanning mode is central focus of study including FSC and BSC covering 92% of sky
   0.2-2.4 keV: Highest sensitivity and resolution at 1 keV
   1sig stat error and 3" systematic error likely
2.3 XMM-Newton Slew Survey
+6240 square degreesof sky (5%)
+Nearly as deep as RASS in soft band 0.2-2 keV
+Deeper and wider than any previous survey in the hard band 2-12 keV
   8" positional error but EPIC-pn resolution of 4" is 6x better than RASS
+Two catalogs: "total" and "clean"
   Clean sample is used: 2713 sources w/ detections in at least one band

3. CROSS-MATCHING
+60" angular separation chosen: still leaves much error due to purely random associations
   ex. PSPC is over order of magnitude worse than SDSS in resolution and astrometry
   Understanding this sample is especially difficult for non-x-ray emitters
   ex. RASS x-ray source covers wide possible area. SDSS shows two objects in that area. there is only one x-ray source so one is quasar and one is H II (in shown example), and quasar must be resolved to be source of x-ray but not H II galaxy
3.1 Obvious X-ray emitters
+Separation should be small for actual true SDSS-RASS x-ray match
+Obvious true matches include quasars and quasar candidates
   Plot distribution of source separation in "source-separation histogram"
   All groups show obvious peak around 10"; quasars have smallest "tail," seeming to approach 0 instead of 100 or 300 as seen with blue and blue2
3.2 Purely Random Matches
+Distribute objects up to 1 degree away from listed location to be random but similar distrib	re-xmatch gives a linearly increasing relationship which can be used to determine impact of random matches on results
3.3 Confirming Quasars
+X-ray positional measurements have normally distributed error
   P(r) ∝ re^(−r^2/2σ^2)/σ^2
+Reproduce distribution by adding probability function with linear function
+At 30" 90% legit, at 60" 6% contamination
3.4 Galaxies
+Galaxy detections rise quickly but remains fairly flat to 60", indicating high random association
+Clean catalog by removing less reliable RASS matches that are close to another source or less reliable than another match of same SDSS source

4. RASS DETECTIONS BY GALAXY SPECTROSCOPIC CLASS
+Split into classes star-forming and AGN to investigate class association to RASS detection likelihood
+High x-ray detection fraction
   AGN (Quasar, LINER, Seyfert)
   Unclassifiable emission: Suggests these have obscured accretion
+Passive, unclassifiable galaxies, and LINERS RASS matches are underpredicted 20"-40"
   Clusters cause nearby x-ray sources
+H II Star-forming never shows above 50% matching fraction
   Higher x-ray observation (xmm-slew, xmm-newton, swift-bat) can see through dust better

5. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: XMM-SLEW
+For comparison to RASS, XMM-slew is crossmatched against SDSS galaxies and quasars
+As of this paper, XMM-slew has too few for same in depth analysis
   Appearance of histogram suggests 20" cut-off
   Most matches soft (0.2-2 keV), a few in hard x-ray

6. CONCLUSIONS
+Likelihood of crossmatch being true match depends heavily on optical classification
+Virtually no RASS matches for star-forming (H II)
+LINERs, Seyfert 2s, transition and unclassified emission galaxies have reliable detections
+Surprising number of RASS detections missing optical emission lines
+This method can be extended to any crossmatch
   Compare source separation histogram with
      linear combination of probability distribution + random matched catalog
