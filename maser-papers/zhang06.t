Extragalactic H2O masers and X-ray absorbing column densities
Zhang et al, 2006

= ABSTRACT =
+H2O spectra for three galaxies (NGC 2273, UGC 5101, NGC 3393) based on search with criteria:
   λ∼1.3 cm (22 GHz) water vapor line
   nuclear activity
   large nuclear column densities or high infrared luminosities
+UGC 5101 (1500 L⊙): Most luminous H2O maser yet found in ultraluminous IR galaxy
+NGC 3393 (400 L⊙): Classical disk maser spectrum with three doppler components
   As usual (unlike NGC4258), masing disk is below 1000 km/s
+NGC 2782, NGC 5728: Chandra archive data indicating AGN, model NH based on hard x-ray emission
   NGC 2782 NH >= 10^24 cm^-2
   NGC 5728 NH ~ 8*10^23 cm^-2
+Correlation between absorbing column and H2O emission?
   kilomasers compton thin: NH < 10^24
   megamasers, 50% compton-thick, 85% are heavily obscured NH > 10^23
      Consistent with seyfert 2 not selected on basis of maser emission
"The similarity in column densities can be explained by small deviations in position between maser spots and nuclear X-ray source and a high degree of clumpiness in the circumnuclear interstellar medium"

1. Introduction
~ J_KaKc = 616−523 line of ortho-H2O at 22 GHz (λ ∼ 1.3 cm) one of the strongest and most remarkable spectral features of the electromagnetic spectrum
+Transition connects 645K above ground state traces warm (Tkin >∼ 400 K) and dense (n(H2) >∼ 107 cm−3) molecular gas
+As a maser the line reaches isotropic luminosities in excess of 10^4 L⊙
+Used to pinpoint sites of massive star formation, now use to determine geometric distances and 3D motions
~ 60 maser galaxies as of this study, associated with
(1) star formation
(2) nuclear accretion disks (“disk-masers”)
(3) interactions of nuclear jet(s) with ambient molecular clouds or to amplification of the jet’s seed photons by suitably located foreground clouds (“jet-masers”)
(4) nuclear outflows.
+Kilomasers (LH2O < 10 L⊙) generally associated with star formation
+Megamasers arise from innermost parsecs of parent galaxy

2. Observations
+100-m telescope of the MPIfR at Effelsberg in June 2001, October 2004 and January and February 2005
+autocorrelator backend was split into eight bands of width 40 or 80 MHz and 512 or 256 channels

3. Results
3.1 UGC 5101
+One of the most luminous megamasers detected: only second in a ultraluminous IR galaxy (ULIRG)
+All water megamasers associated with AGN
+Starforming masers do not surpass 10 L⊙
+Cumulative luminosity of many sources may be but probably is not comparable to megamaser 
   UGC 5101 + Arp 220 have many 0.01–1 L⊙ masers which could lead to detectable H2O emission
   Arp should show 5x stronger emission from this than UGC 5101, however it was not detected at all
+UGC 5101 hosts LINER nucleus with 6.4 keV spectral feature
   Radio + IR suggest AGN
+NGC 6240: Other ULIRG with water maser, H2O emission coincides with one of two nuclei of interacting galaxies
3.2 NGC 2273
+Barred early type spiral galaxy with Seyfert 2 nucleus
+Least luminous of three: LH2O < 10 L⊙, kilomaser, associated with prominent star formation instead of AGN
+Many signs of star formation, however molecular gas streaming toward innermost region with compton-thick x-ray source: nuclear maser is possible
3.3 NGC 3393
+Barred early type spiral with Seyfert 2 nucleus, seen nearly face on
+Lineshape similar to NGC 4258
   Suggests nuclear origin of maser is evident
   Accreting disk must be viewed approximately edge on, so rotation velocity of 460 km/s
+None match NGC 4258 at ~1000 km/s

4. Radio vs X-ray data
4.1 General aspects
+Megamaser survey detection rates generally low
+As suggested by Braatz, nuclear x-ray NH may be high for masers
+Connect H2O with total column density, H2O abundances necessary
   [H2O]/[H2] ~ 10^-9 - 10^-7 in cool molecular clouds, 10^-6 in stellar outflow, 10^-4 in warm shock heated gas
   H2O column densities 10^18 - 10^20 needed for efficient maser amplification, require total H2 > 10^22
+Progress since Braatz
   number of sources quadrupled
   X-ray spectrum models better explain column densities for significant number of AGN
+Compton-thick galaxies of special interest: 10^24 cm-2
   Most of this column densities comes from circumnuclear shell or torus, 100 times normal galaxies
   ULIRGS even smaller
   Must be dense and mostly molecular
4.2 X-ray data
~ 64 maser galaxies compared against ASCA, BeppoSAX, XMM, CSC to identify correltion between NH and maser
+13 kilomasers LH2O<10L⊙, 51 megamasers
+All but two kilomasers are compton thin
+About half of megamasers have published NH
+Chose to calculate for NGC 2782 and NGC 5728
4.2.1 Data Acquisition and reduction
+Use Chandra observations in 2002 and 2003, ensure no flaring events etc.
4.2.2 Spatial Analysis
+Both sources have bright unresolved core and extended regions with emission several arcseconds
+Both emission regions have optical and radio counterparts
+NGC2782: Relatively weak larg-scale emitting region elongated north south
   Teardrop shape consistent with Hα structure seen in HST
   Hα + Nii structure shows x-ray knot 6.5" south of nucleus surrounded by shell of line emitting clouds
   Shell associated with starburst driven outflow bubble
   5 GHz radio counterpart of southern bubble, second bubble of similar size on opposite side
   Hidden AGN like nucleus from x-ray spectrum + maser emission suggest more dominant role of central engine
+NGC5728: Elongated structure SE to NW
   Soft x-ray from SE and harder emission from NW
   Possibly SE region is closer to observer, supported by HST emission lines
4.2.3 Spectral analysis
+"Canonical" Seyfert 2 spectrum: absorbed power law plus soft excess
+Attempted to model spectral shape of both sources
   I. Compton-thick high energy reflection spectrum
        Reflection of seed photons off dense matter > 10^24 cm^-2 in disk
	This model is sensitive to orientation of disk
	Preferred for NGC 2782
   II. Partially absorbed power law
        Fraction of source is absorbed by intervening material 10^22
	Preferred for NGC 5728

5. Discussion
~ Many compications for this comparision
+38 maser sources compared, not all can permit meaningful comparison b/n maser + NH
+Ideally see X-ray source both in nucleus and maser - condition not fulfilled
+H2O line submilliarcsecond
+Can only see systemic (not blueshift and redshift) components from in front of nucleus
+Column density estimates related to x-ray emission may be mostly scattered light
+Because of these complications, correlation would seem undetectable
~ Megamasers associated with higher NH than kilomasers
+All kilomasers except NGC 2273 and 5194 are compton thin
+H2O megamasers exist preferentially in environments iwth higher obscuration, circumnuclear regions of high NH
   85% NH > 10^23; 50% NH > 10^24
   These properties consistent with Seyfert 2
+Nuclear column density is a very solid guide when searching for megamaser emission
   Cause for this is unclear
+Why are they different?
   One on hand, maybe high degree of small clumps in observed clouds
   On other hand, milliarcsecond offsets between megamaser and nuclear x-ray expected
      Offsets much larger in kilomaser sources
      Three kilomasers known to be nuclear 1" from center
+Weak correlation between rising column density with maser luminosity
   Megamaser subsample alone shows no trend

6. Conclusions
~ Detected H2O emission in NGC 2273, UGC 5101, and NGC 3393 with isotropic luminosities of 7, 1500, and 400 L⊙
+UGC 5101: first maser in ULIRG
+NGC 2273: nuclear or massive star formation
+NGC 3393: classical NGC 4258 profile, rotation well below 1000km/s
~ Chandra X-ray images and spectra analyze NGC 2782 and NGC 5728
+NGC 2782: Hidden AGN, high energy reflection, maser probably star forming
+NGC 5728: Biconical axisymmetric structure of ionizing region, as suggested by HST
~ Correlation between X-ray absorbing column density and H2O emission, 64 galaxies
+99.4% confidence kilo- and mega- are different
+Megamasers indistinguishable from Seyfert 2
+Clumpy cloud structure can explain lack of clear correlation
~ AGN type 2 identification justifies H2O maser emission
