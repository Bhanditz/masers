Water Maser Emission from X-ray heated circumnuclear gas in active galaxies
Neufeld et al, 1994

= ABSTRACT =
+Model physical and chemical conditions w/in circumnuclear gas irradiated by X-rays from AGN
+X-ray heating > molecular layer 400-1000 K with high H2O abundance
+Naturally results in maser emission 22GHz with maser lum 10^2 L⊙
+Surface luminosities sufficiently explain large apparent luminosities in water maser sources associated with AGN

1. Introduction
~ 22GHz water maser emission as large as 520 L⊙ as of study
+13 known sources above 35 L⊙: galaxies with evidence of nuclear activity
   9 are Seyfert, four are LINERS
+NGC 1068 prototypical
   700km/s
   350 L⊙
~ Interferometry (NGC 1068 + NGC 4258) indicates entire flux generated within diameter of 3.5 and 1.3 pc respectively
+Sizes of emission regions are proposed to be smaller than projected upper limits
+VLBI shows strongest spectral features in NGC 3079, 1068, 4258 within 0.01 pc
   Velocity gradients suggest masing material orbits nucleaus
   NGC 4258 velocity range/velocity gradient estimates 0.1 pc for actual radius of masing material
      This galaxy masing gas is thin toroid of inner radius 0.1pc and thickness <0.02 pc
~ Microphysics of emission rather than geometry of maser source
+Irradiated directly by X-rays of central nucleus
   Additionally, upper and lower surfaces irradiated indirectly by scattered X-rays, obliquely by source

2. Calculation
~ Describe a simple model to compute physical and chemical conditions within isobaric slab illuminated by X-ray
+Model for such conditions:
   pressure p/k = (10^11)(p_11) K/cm^3
   Illuminated by flux of F_x = (10^5)(F_5) ergs/cm^2*s
   F_5 = 0.84(L_x/10^43 ergs/s)(pc/R^2): R is distance form surface to source
   Spectral index α = 0.7 (a measure of the dependence of radiative flux density on frequency - wiki)
   X-ray luminosity L_x and flux F_x refer to energy range 1-100keV
   Temperature and chemical abundances function of depth z into slab
+Equilibrium temp: balance X-ray heating and radiative cooling
   Rotational and vibrational cooling by H2, OH, H2O, CO
   Gas-grain cooling
   H2 dissociation
+Equilibrium chemical (eg. H2O) abundances calculated considering 113 reactions wof 29 species
+X-ray heated gas possesses two phase structure. Atomic phase T~5k-8k K; molecular phase 600-2500 K
+Maser Luminosity calculated from above: temp, density, and H2O abundance as function of depth

3. Results
+Resuls include self-consistent treatment of radiative trapping effects in molecular cooling transitions
+Masing occurs in specific depth band
   cooler/further than atomic phase, must be cool enough for molecular structures (H2O)
   warm/close enough that masing is continuous, cooler than this would lose masing effect due to radiative trapping
      (necessity for population inversion is probably the explanation here?)

4. Discussion
+Luminous maser emission possible over wide range of parameters L_sat = 32-325 L⊙/pc^2
+L_sat/F_x maser efficiency ranges 10^-7 - 10^-5.5
+Maser emission may be strongly beamed oe anisotropic, apparent vs true luminosity may differ
+Torus shape and irregularities can alter luminosity
+front and back of torus may interact
+Brightness may be dependent on azimuthal variation relative to equatorial plane
+150 L⊙ of NGC 4258 could result from a 4x enhancement based on a particular azimuthal observation direction.
+Shielding effects may permit masing close to illuminated surface
+Depth of masing layer determined by radiative trapping
