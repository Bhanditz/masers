PREVALENCE OF HIGH X-RAY OBSCURING COLUMNS AMONG AGNs THAT HOST H2O MASERS

ABSTRACT
+104 known AGN with x-ray emission, x-ray data to estimate NH for 42, analyze 8 new
+5 of 8 new cases, maser spectra edge on
+95% NH > 10^23, 60% NH > 10^24, for disk masers 76% NH > 10^24

1. Introduction
+Zhang results 85%, 50%, mostly compton thick for nuclei
+Plausible that AGN with maser have high NH in general b/c large molecular gas reservoirs required for maser amplification
   high NH anticipated because emission expected to arise in inclined disk structures

2. Data Analysis
~ XMM-Newton: Observed 7 maser AGN
+Also identified unpublished observations of five disk-maser hosts in XMM and CSC archives (12 obj total)
+All eight observations, hard coninua above 2 keV
+Strong lines from continuum reprocessing via fluorescence, central engine seen compton reflection
+Low signal to noise, minimum model established
+Assumed continuum described by reflection, gamma=1.7 fixed
+Fe Kα lines as gaussians 6.4 keV rest frame energy sigma = 20 eV intrinsic width
+Spectral fitting shows Fe Kα line emission in Mrk 34, Mrk 1419, NGC 6926, NGC 5793
+EW Equivalent Width of the line calculated
+MEKAL component added below 2 keV
+Mrk 34, Mrk 1419, and NGC 6926  NH = (1–2)*10^24
+NGC 1194 NH + 1.06 * 10^24
+NGC 1194 also has K alpha for Si, S, Ca, broadened due to photoionization and blending of emission states

3. Discussion
~ Estimates and limits on NH on 42 out of 104 AGN
   31 AGN with megamaser and weaker
   2 Zhang AGN
   5 AGN treated here
   4 nuclei with recently discovered maser emission
+60% are compton thick, 76% of disk masers are compton thick
   distribution is significantly skewed and non-gaussian
+AGN masers without evidence of edge on are more compton thin
~ NH for AGN w/ maser vs AGN w/o maser
+Distinction may still be greater than estimated
   Maser identification relies on red/blueshifted spectrum
   Disks may be edge-one, resulting in large colums while spectroscopic markers may be absent
~ AGN Masers
+58% of masers are compton thick matching AGN broadly
+NH >= 10^23 more common among maser AGN than 22 hard x-ray seleted non-maser AGN: 95% vs 50%
+for NH >= 10^24 incidence rates are similar: 60% vs 50%
~ Demonstrated correlation between maser emission and high NH = new strategy to find obscured AGN
+Heavily obscured AGN low apparent luminosity, hard to find 100ks, maser found in 1ks
+Maser gas may be responsible for obscuration in type 2 objects
