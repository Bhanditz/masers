ABSTRACT
+Catalogued down count rate of 0.05 cts/s in the 0.1-2.4keV energy band with a detection likelihood of a least 15 and at least 15 source counts.
2. The ROSAT all-sky survey
+Conducted the first All Sky Surveysin soft X-rays (0.1-2.4keV) and the extreme ultraviolet (0.0250.2keV)
+Source detection algorithm
   Local detect method uses three energy bands
      PHA: Pulse Height Amplitude channels 11-235 (0.1-2.4keV)
      Soft channels 11-41 (0.1-0.4keV)
      Hard channels 52-201 (0.5-2.0keV)
   4 energy bands are chosen to calculate detectio likelihood
      A (11-41) PHA Channels
      B (52-201)
      C (52-90)
      D (91-201)
2.2.3 Parameters derived from the RASS-II processing
   Two hardness ratios HR1 and HR2 are calculated
      HR1 = (B-A)/(B+A)
      HR2 = (D-C)/(D+C)
      Some background substraction results in negative values which are set to zero
3.1 Selection criteria
RBSC was selected according to the following criteria: (i) the detection likelihood is ≥ 15; (ii) the number of source photons is ≥ 15 and (iii) the source count-rate in the (0.1−2.4 keV) energy band is ≥ 0.05counts s−1
3.3.1 Sky- and count-rate distributions
   HR1 has five intervals that display Bright (>1.3 counts/s) hard x-ray sources in the galactic plane (Faint is <1.3 counts/s)

3.3.5 Flux determination and log N-log S distributions
   Two models to convert count rate into flux in the 0.1-2.4keV range
-->Model 1 for AGN and galaxy clusters: assumes power law
	  E^(−Γ+1) dE
          Fixed photon index of Γ = 2.3 which is typical value derived from ROSAT observing extragalactic
      Model 2 originally for stars, baed on empirical conversion between count rates and fluxes
          ﬂux2 = (5.3·HR1 + 8.31)·10−12·counts s−1[erg cm−2s−1]
   Both flux values flux1 and flux2 are listed in electric form of catalogue
